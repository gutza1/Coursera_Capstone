-- Introduction/Business --

With a population that has grown from 2,500,000 to 3,000,000 in the last two decades, Toronto is a burgeoning and dynamic city, with plenty of business opportunities. One of those is opening a restaurant to service Toronto's population. However, a good choice of location is critical for the success of a restaurant, but identifying one may be difficult. This is where machine learning can be used to identify the average popularity of restaurants in each of Toronto's neighborhoods that lie inside the main five boroughs, indicating which neighborhood an enterprising restaurant owner should start their venue in.

-- Data --

To find the most profitable neighborhoods for restaurants in central Toronto, two kinds of data is required: geographical data, and venue data. The geographical data that this project will be using is Wikipedia's list of every Toronto neighborhood and its postal code, as well as a CSV file containing the geographical coordinates of each postal code. 

Wikipedia list: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M

Example (Postal Code, Borough, Neighbourhood): [M3A, North York, Parkwoods]

CSV file: https://cocl.us/Geospatial_data

Example (Postal Code, Latitude, Longitude): [M3A, 43.7532586, -79.3296565]

Venue data will be acquired through Fourspace and its API. The project will be fetching the tipCount variable, from stats (takes the form of [checkinsCount, usersCount, tipCount] for each venue.

-- Methodology --

The analysis will use the number of tips recorded per restaurant as a proxy for profitability, and will find the total number of tips per neighborhood to estimate the suitability of a neighborhood for a restaurant. No machine learning is necessary.

-- Results --

These are the top ten neighbourhoods in Toronto's central five boroughs, sorted in descending order by the total tip count of each restaurant in it:

	Neighbourhood	                            Tip Count
3	St. James Town	                            247
14	Commerce Court, Victoria Hotel	            234
11	Toronto Dominion Centre, Design Exchange	190
7	Richmond, Adelaide, King	                187
23	First Canadian Place, Underground city	    187
2	Garden District, Ryerson	                113
21	Stn A PO Boxes	                            91
4	Berczy Park	                                89
24	Church and Wellesley	                    88
18	University of Toronto, Harbord	            38

-- Discussion --

It seems that the most profitable areas are St. James Town and Commerce Court, followed by the Toronto Dominion Centre, Richmond, and First Canadian Place. An entrepeneur who wishes to start a restaurant in Toronto should try to find a location in the first two neighborhoods, but if the price of real estate in those neighborhoods are too expensive, the latter three will also suffice.

-- Conclusion --

Most of the commercial restaurant activity in Toronto's central five boroughs is concentrated in five neighborhoods: St. James Town, Commerce Court, Toronto Dominion Centre, Richmod, and First Canadian Place. These are the best places for entrepeneurs to start new restaurants.
